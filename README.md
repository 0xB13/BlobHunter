# BlobHunter

a tool for scanning Azure blob storage accounts for publicly opened blobs.  
BlobHunter is a part of  "Hunting Blobs For Fun And Glory" research: {TODO: add here link to blog-post.}

## Overview

BlobHunter helps you identify Azure blob storage stored files that are publicly opened to everyone over the internet.  
It can help you check for poorly configured containers storing sensitive data.  
This can be helpful on large subscriptions where there are lots of storage accounts that can be hard to track.  
BlobHunter produces an informative csv result file with important details on each publicly opened container in the tested environment.

## Requirements

1. Python 3+

2. Azure CLI

3. [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) packages

4. Azure account with one of the following General/Storage [built-in roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles):

   -	[Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor)
   -	[Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)
   -	[Avere Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#avere-contributor)
   -	[Classic Storage Account Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#classic-storage-account-contributor)
   -	[Storage Account Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor)
   
   Or any Azure account with a role that allows to perform the next Azure actions:
   
   ```
   Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read
   Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read
   Microsoft.ClassicStorage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read
   Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/blobs/read
   ```

## Build

#### Example for installation on Ubuntu:

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 

Simply run 

```
python3 BlobHunter.py
